    <h2>
      I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Under a boat, high and dry at low tide, on the beach, John Wood was seated
      in the sand, sheltered from the sun in the boat's shadow, absorbed in the
      laying on of verdigris. The dull, worn color was rapidly giving place to a
      brilliant, shining green. Occasionally a scraper, which lay by, was taken
      up to remove the last trace of a barnacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Wood's boat, but he was not a boatman; he painted cleverly, but he
      was not a painter. He kept the brown store under the elms of the main
      street, now hot and still, where at this-moment his blushing sister was
      captivating the heart of an awkward farmer's boy as she sold him a pair of
      striped suspenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the church clock struck the last of twelve decided blows, three
      children came rushing out of the house on the bank above the beach. It was
      one of those deceptive New England cottages, weather-worn without, but
      bright and bountifully home-like within,&mdash;with its trim parlor, proud
      of a cabinet organ; with its front hall, now cooled by the light
      sea-breeze drifting through the blind-door, where a tall clock issued its
      monotonous call to a siesta on the rattan lounge; with its spare room,
      open now, opposite the parlor, and now, too, drawing in the salt air
      through close-shut blinds, in anticipation of the joyful arrival this
      evening of Sister Sarah, with her little brood, from the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children scampered across the road, and then the eldest hushed the
      others and sent a little brother ahead to steal, barefoot, along the
      shining sea-weed to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plotted surprise appeared to succeed completely. The painter was
      seized by the ears from behind, and captured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess who 's here, or you can't get up,&rdquo; said the infant captor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It 's Napoleon Bonaparte; don't joggle,&rdquo; said his father, running a brush
      steadily along the water-line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo; with shouts of laughter from the whole attacking party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it's Captain Ezekiel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This excited great merriment: Captain Ezekiel was an aged, purblind man,
      who leaned on a cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      After attempts to identify the invader&mdash;with the tax-collector come
      for taxes, then with the elderly minister making a pastoral call, with the
      formal schoolmaster, and with Samuel J. Tilden&mdash;the victim reached
      over his shoulder, and, seizing the assailant by a handful of calico
      jacket, brought him around, squirming, before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I 'll give you a coat of verdigris. (Great applause from
      the reserve force behind.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Mother sent you to say dinner's ready,&rdquo; said the father, rising
      and surveying the green bottom of the boat. &ldquo;I must eat quick, so as to do
      the other side before half-flood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with a child on each shoulder, and the third pushing him from behind
      with her head, he marched toward the vine-covered kitchen, where, between
      two opposite netted doors, the table was trimly set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you look like a mermaid, with your green hands,&rdquo; said his wife,
      laughing, as she handed him the spirits of turpentine. &ldquo;A woman could
      paint that boat, in a light dress, and not get a spot on her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled good-naturedly: he never spoke much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Louise won't have much trade today,&rdquo; said his wife, as they all
      sat down; &ldquo;it's so hot in the sun that everybody 'll wait till night. But
      she has her tatting-work to do, and she 's got a book, too, that she
      wanted to finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her husband nodded, and ate away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, can't we go up street and see her, this afternoon?&rdquo; said one of the
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can that be?&rdquo; said the mother, as an elderly, half-official-looking
      man stopped his horse at the front gate and alighted. The man left the
      horse unchecked to browse by the roadside, and came to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it 's you, Captain Nourse,&rdquo; said Wood, rising to open the netting
      door, and holding out his hand. &ldquo;Come to summons me as a witness in
      something about the bank case, I suppose. Let me introduce Captain Nourse,
      Mary,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;deputy sheriff. Sit down, Captain, and have some dinner
      with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess I won't set,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;I cal'lated not to eat till
      I got home, in the middle o' the afternoon. No, I 'll set down in eye-shot
      of the mare, and read the paper while you eat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope they don't want me to testify anywhere to-day,&rdquo; said Wood;
      &ldquo;because my boat's half verdigris'd, and I want to finish her this
      afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No testimony to-day,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;Hi! hi! Kitty!&rdquo; he called to the
      mare, as she began to meander across the road; and he went out to a tree
      by the front fence, and sat down on a green bench, beside a work-basket
      and a half-finished child's dress, and read the country paper which he had
      taken from the office as he came along.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner Wood went out bareheaded, and leaned on the fence by the
      captain. His wife stood just inside the door, looking out at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;bank case&rdquo; was the great sensation of the town, and Wood was one of
      the main witnesses, for he had been taking the place of the absent cashier
      when the safe was broken open and rifled to the widespread distress of
      depositors and stockholders, and the ruin of Hon. Edward Clark, the
      president. Wood had locked the safe on the afternoon before the eventful
      night, and had carried home the key with him, and he was to testify to the
      contents of the safe as he had left it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess they 're glad they 've got such a witness as John,&rdquo; said his wife
      to herself, as she looked at him fondly, &ldquo;and I guess they think there
      won't be much doubt about what he says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain,&rdquo; said Wood, jocosely, breaking a spear of grass to bits in
      his fingers, &ldquo;I did n't know but you 'd come to arrest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain calmly smiled as only a man can smile who has been accosted
      with the same humorous remark a dozen times a day for twenty years. He
      folded his paper carefully, put it in his pocket, took off his spectacles
      and put them in their silver case, took a red silk handkerchief from his
      hat, wiped his face, and put the handkerchief back. Then he said shortly,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I <i>have</i> come for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wood, still leaning on the fence, looked at him, and said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's just what I 've come for,&rdquo; said Captain Nourse. &ldquo;I 've got to
      arrest you; here's the warrant.&rdquo; And he handed it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; said Wood. &ldquo;I can't make head or tail of this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;the long and short is, these high-toned
      detectives that they 've hed down from town, seein' as our own force was
      n't good enough, allow that the safe was unlocked with a key, in due form,
      and then the lock was broke afterward, to look as if it had been forced
      open. They 've hed the foreman of the safe-men down, too, and he says the
      same thing. Naturally, the argument is, there was only two keys in
      existence,&mdash;one was safe with the president of the bank, and is about
      all he 's got to show out of forty years' savings; the only other one you
      hed: consequently, it heaves it onto you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Wood. &ldquo;I will go with you. Do you want to come into the
      house with me while I get my coat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I suppose I must keep you in sight,&mdash;now you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they went into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said her husband, &ldquo;the folks that lost by Clark when the bank
      broke have been at him until he 's felt obliged to pitch on somebody, and
      he's pitched on me; and Captain Nourse has come to arrest me. I shall get
      bail before long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, and did not shed a tear till he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But then&mdash;

    <h2>
      II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Wide wastes of salt-marsh to the right, imprisoning the upland with a vain
      promise of infinite liberty, and, between low, distant sandhills, a rim of
      sea. Stretches of pine woods behind, shutting in from the great outer
      world, and soon to darken into evening gloom. Ploughed fields and
      elm-dotted pastures to the left, and birch-lined roads leading by white
      farm-houses to the village, all speaking of cheer and freedom to the
      prosperous and the happy, but to the unfortunate and the indebted, of
      meshes invisible but strong as steel. But, before, no lonesome marshes, no
      desolate forest, no farm or village street, but the free blue ocean,
      rolling and tumbling still from the force of an expended gale.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the open doorway of a little cottage, warmed by the soft slanting rays
      of the September sun, a rough man, burnt and freckled, was sitting, at his
      feet a net, engaged upon some handiwork which two little girls were
      watching. Close by him lay a setter, his nose between his paws.
      Occasionally the man raised his eyes to scan the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's Joel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;comin' in around the Bar. Not much air stirrin'
      now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he turned to his work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First, you go <i>so</i> fash',&rdquo; he said to the children, as he drew a
      thread; &ldquo;then you go <i>so</i> fash'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as he worked he made a great show of labor, much to their diversion.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sight of Joel's broad white sail had not brought pleasant thoughts
      to his mind; for Joel had hailed him, off the Shoal, the afternoon before,
      and had obligingly offered to buy his fish right there, and so let him go
      directly home, omitting to mention that sudden jump of price due to an
      empty market.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what poor man he 's took a dollar out of to-day! Well, I s'pose
      it's all right: those that 's got money, want money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What be you, Eli&mdash;ganging on hooks?&rdquo; said Aunt Patience, as she
      tiptoed into the kitchen behind him, from his wife's sick-room, and softly
      closed the door after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the elder of the children; &ldquo;he 's mending our stockings, and
      showing me how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you do have a hard time, don't you?&rdquo; said Aunt Patience, looking
      down over his shoulder; &ldquo;to slave and tug and scrape to get a house over
      your head, and then to have to turn square 'round, and stay to home with a
      sick woman, and eat all into it with mortgages!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we 'll fetch, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Patience went to the glass, and holding a black pin in her mouth,
      carefully tied the strings of her sun-bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anyway,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;you take it good-natured. Though if there is one
      thing that's harder than another, it is to be good-natured all the time,
      without being aggravating. I have known men that was so awfully
      good-natured that they was harder to live with than if they was cross!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And without specifying further, she opened her plaid parasol and stepped
      out at the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though, on this quiet afternoon of Saturday, the peace of the approaching
      Sabbath seemed already brooding over the little dwelling, peace had not
      lent her hand to the building of the home. Every foot of land, every
      shingle, every nail, had been wrung from the reluctant sea. Every voyage
      had contributed something. It was a great day when Eli was able to buy the
      land. Then, between two voyages, he dug a cellar and laid a foundation;
      then he saved enough to build the main part of the cottage and to finish
      the front room, lending his own hand to the work. Then he used to get
      letters at every port, telling of progress,&mdash;how Lizzie, his wife,
      had adorned the front room with a bright ninepenny paper, of which a
      little piece was enclosed,&mdash;which he kept as a sort of charm about
      him and exhibited to his friends; how she and her little brother had
      lathed the entry and the kitchen, and how they had set out blackberry
      vines from the woods. Then another letter told of a surprise awaiting him
      on his return; and, in due time, coming home as third mate from Hong-Kong
      to a seaman's tumultuous welcome, he had found that a great, good-natured
      mason, with whose sick child his wife had watched night after night, had
      appeared one day with lime and hair and sand, and in white raiment, and
      had plastered the entry and the kitchen, and finished a room upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so, for years, at home and on the sea, at New York and at Valparaiso
      and in the Straits of Malacca, the little house and the little family
      within it had grown into the fibre of Eli's heart. Nothing had given him
      more delight than to meet, in the strange streets of Calcutta or before
      the Mosque of Omar, some practical Yankee from Stonington or Machias, and,
      whittling to discuss with him, among the turbans of the Orient, the
      comparative value of shaved and of sawed shingles, or the economy of
      &ldquo;Swedes-iron&rdquo; nails, and to go over with him the estimates and plans which
      he had worked out in his head under all the constellations of the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supper things were cleared away. The children had said good-night and
      gone to bed, and Eli had been sitting for an hour by his wife's bedside.
      He had had to tax his patience and ingenuity heavily during the long
      months that she had lain there to entertain her for a little while in the
      evening, after his hard, wet day's work. He had been talking now of the
      coming week, when he was to serve upon the jury in the adjoining
      county-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cal'late I can come home about every night,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it 'll be
      quite a change, at any rate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't seem so cheerful about it as I counted you would be,&rdquo; said
      his wife. &ldquo;Are you afraid you'll have to be on the bank case?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;No trouble 'n that case! Jury won't leave their
      seats. These city fellers 'll find they 've bit off more 'n they can chew
      when they try to figure out John Wood done that. I only hope I 'll have
      the luck to be on that case&mdash;all hands on the jury whisper together a
      minute, and then clear him, right on the spot, and then shake hands with
      him all 'round!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But something is worrying you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is it? You have looked it
      since noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nothin',&rdquo; he replied&mdash;&ldquo;only George Cahoon came up to-noon to say
      that he was goin' West next week, and that he would have to have that
      money he let me have awhile ago. And where to get it&mdash;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <a name="link2H_4_0003" id="link2H_4_0003">

    <h2>
      III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The court-room was packed. John Wood's trial was drawing to its close. Eli
      was on the jury. Some one had advised the prosecuting attorney, in a
      whisper, to challenge him, but he had shaken his head and said,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I could n't afford to challenge him for that; it would only leak out,
      and set the jury against me. I 'll risk his standing out against this
      evidence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The trial had been short. It had been shown how the little building of the
      bank had been entered. Skilled locksmiths from the city had testified that
      the safe was opened with a key, and that the lock was broken afterward,
      from the inside, plainly to raise the theory of a forcible entry by
      strangers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been proved that the only key in existence, not counting that kept
      by the president, was in the possession of Wood, who was filling, for a
      few days, the place of the cashier&mdash;the president's brother&mdash;in
      his absence. It had been shown that Wood was met, at one o'clock of the
      night in question, crossing the fields toward his home, from the direction
      of the bank, with a large wicker basket slung over his shoulders,
      returning, as he had said, from eel-spearing in Harlow's Creek; and there
      was other circumstantial evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Clark, the president of the bank, had won the sympathy of every one by
      the modest way in which, with his eye-glasses in his hand, he had
      testified to the particulars of the loss which had left him penniless, and
      had ruined others whose little all was in his hands. And then in reply to
      the formal question, he had testified, amid roars of laughter from the
      court-room, that it was not he who robbed the safe. At this, even the
      judge and Wood's lawyer had not restrained a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had left the guilt with Wood. His lawyer, an inexperienced young
      attorney,&mdash;who had done more or less business for the bank and would
      hardly have ventured to defend this case but that the president had kindly
      expressed his entire willingness that he should do so,&mdash;had, of
      course, not thought it worth while to cross-examine Mr. Clark, and had
      directed his whole argument against the theory that the safe had been
      opened with a key, and not by strangers. But he had felt all through that,
      as a man politely remarked to him when he finished, he was only butting
      his &ldquo;head ag'in a stone wall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And while he was arguing, a jolly-looking old lawyer had written, in the
      fly-leaf of a law-book on his knee, and had passed with a wink to a young
      man near him who had that very morning been admitted to the bar, these
      lines:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;When callow Blackstones soar too high,
     Quit common-sense, and reckless fly,
     Soon, Icarus-like, they headlong fall,
     And down come client, case, and all.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The district-attorney had not thought it worth while to expend much
      strength upon his closing argument; but being a jovial stump-speaker, of a
      wide reputation within narrow limits, he had not been able to refrain from
      making merry over Wood's statement that the basket which he had been seen
      bearing home, on the eventful night, was a basket of eels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine eels those, gentlemen! We have seen gold-fish and silver-fish, but
      golden eels are first discovered by this defendant The apostle, in Holy
      Writ, caught a fish with a coin in its mouth; but this man leaves the
      apostle in the dim distance when he finds eels that are all money. No
      storied fisherman of Bagdad, catching enchanted princes disguised as
      fishes in the sea, ever hooked such a treasure as this defendant hooked
      when he hooked that basket of eels! [Rustling appreciation of the jest
      among the jury.] If a squirming, twisting, winding, wriggling eel,
      gentlemen, can be said at any given moment to have a back, we may
      distinguish this new-found species as the greenback eel. It is a common
      saying that no man can hold an eel and remain a Christian. I should like
      to have viewed the pious equanimity of this good man when he laid his
      hands on that whole bed of eels. In happy, barefoot boyhood, gentlemen, we
      used to find mud-turtles marked with initials or devices cut in their
      shells; but what must have been our friend's surprise to find, in the
      muddy bed of Harlow's Creek, eels marked with a steel-engraving of the
      landing of Columbus and the signature of the Register of the Treasury! I
      hear that a corporation is now being formed by the title of The Harlow's
      Creek Greenback National Bank-bill Eel-fishing Company, to follow up, with
      seines and spears, our worthy friend's discovery! I learn that the news of
      this rich placer has spread to the golden mountains of the West, and that
      the exhausted intellects which have been reduced to such names for their
      mines as 'The Tombstone,' 'The Red Dog,' the 'Mrs. E. J. Parkhurst,' are
      likely now to flood us with prospectuses of the 'Eel Mine,' 'The Flat
      Eel,' 'The Double Eel,' and then, when they get ready to burst upon
      confiding friends, 'The Consolidated Eels.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It takes but little to make a school or a court-room laugh, and the speech
      had appeared to give a good deal of amusement to the listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      To all?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did it amuse that man who sat, with folded arms, harsh and rigid, at the
      dock? Did it divert that white-faced woman, cowering in a corner,
      listening as in a dream?
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge now charged the jury briefly. It was unnecessary for him, he
      said, to recapitulate evidence of so simple a character. The chief
      question for the jury was as to the credibility of the witnesses. If the
      witnesses for the prosecution were truthful and were not mistaken, the
      inference of guilt seemed inevitable; this the defendant's counsel had
      conceded. The defendant had proved a good reputation; upon that point
      there was only this to be said: that, while such evidence was entitled to
      weight, yet, on the other hand, crimes involving a breach of trust could,
      from their very nature, be committed only by persons whose good
      reputations secured them positions of trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury-room had evidently not been furnished by a ring. It had a long
      table for debate, twelve hard chairs for repose, twelve spittoons for
      luxury, and a clock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury sat in silence for a few moments, as old Captain Nourse, who had
      them in his keeping, and eyed them as if he was afraid that he might lose
      one of them in a crack and be held accountable on his bond, rattled away
      at the unruly lock. Looking at them then, you would have seen faces all of
      a New England cast but one. There was a tall, powerful negro called George
      Washington, a man well known in this county town, to which he had come, as
      driftwood from the storm of war, in '65. Some of the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; had heard him,
      in a great prayer-meeting in Washington&mdash;a city which he always spoke
      of as his &ldquo;namesake&rdquo;&mdash;at the time of the great review, say, in his
      strong voice, with that pathetic quaver in it: &ldquo;Like as de parched an'
      weary traveller hangs his harp upon de winder, an' sighs for oysters in de
      desert, so I longs to res' my soul an' my foot in Mass'-chusetts;&rdquo; and
      they were so delighted with him that they invited him on the spot to go
      home with them, and took up a collection to pay his fare; and so he was a
      public character. As for his occupation,&mdash;when the census-taker, with
      a wink to the boys in the store, had asked him what it was, he had said,
      in that same odd tone: &ldquo;Putties up glass a little&mdash;whitewashes a
      little&mdash;&rdquo; and, when the man had made a show of writing all that down,
      &ldquo;preaches a little.&rdquo; He might have said, &ldquo;preaches a big,&rdquo; for you could
      hear him half a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman was a retired sea-captain. &ldquo;Good cap'n&mdash;Cap'n Thomas,&rdquo;
       one of his neighbors had said of him. &ldquo;Allers gits good ships&mdash;never
      hez to go huntin' 'round for a vessel. But it is astonishin' what
      differences they is! Now there 's Cap'n A. K. P. Bassett, down to the West
      Harbor. You let it git 'round that Cap'n A. K. P. is goin' off on a Chiny
      voyage, and you 'll see half a dozen old shays to once-t, hitched all
      along his fence of an arternoon, and wimmen inside the house, to git Cap'n
      A. K. P. to take their boys. But you let Cap'n Thomas give out that he
      wants boys, and he hez to glean 'em&mdash;from the poor-house, and from
      step-mothers, and where he can: the women knows! Still,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;Cap'n
      Thomas 's a good cap'n. I've nothin' to say ag'in him. He's smart!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the foreman, when the officer, at last, had securely
      locked them in, &ldquo;shall we go through the formality of a ballot? If the
      case were a less serious one, we might have rendered a verdict in our
      seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the use foolin' 'round ballotin'?&rdquo; said a thick-set butcher.
      &ldquo;Ain't we all o' one mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is for you to say, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the foreman. &ldquo;I should n't want to
      have it go abroad that we had not acted formally, if there was any one
      disposed to cavil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; said George Washington, rising and standing in the attitude
      of Webster, &ldquo;I rises to appoint to order. We took ballast in de prior
      cases, and why make flesh of one man an' a fowl of another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said the foreman, a trifle sharply; &ldquo;'the longest way round
      is the shortest way home.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Twelve slips of paper were handed out, to be indorsed guilty, &ldquo;for form.&rdquo;
       They were collected in a hat and the foreman told them over&mdash;&ldquo;just
      for form.&rdquo; &ldquo;'Guilty,' 'guilty,' 'guilty,' 'guilty,'&mdash;wait a minute,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;here is a mistake. Here is one 'not guilty'&mdash;whose is
      this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose is it?&rdquo; said the foreman, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eli turned a little red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's mine,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I mean it,&rdquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; whistled the foreman. &ldquo;Very well, sir; we'll have an
      understanding, then. This case is proved to the satisfaction of every man
      who heard it, I may safely say, but one. Will that one please state the
      grounds of his opinion?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't no talker,&rdquo; said Eli, &ldquo;but I ain't satisfied he 's guilty&mdash;that's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you believe the witnesses?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mostly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which one don't you believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't say. I don't believe he's guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there one that you think lied?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now it seems to me&mdash;&rdquo; said a third juryman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One thing at a time, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the foreman. &ldquo;Let us wait for an
      answer from Mr. Smith. Is there any one that you think lied? We will wait,
      gentlemen, for an answer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. The trial seemed to Eli Smith to have shifted from
      the court to this shabby room, and he was now the culprit.
    </p>
    <p>
      All waited for him; all eyes were fixed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The clock ticked loud! Eli counted the seconds. He knew the determination
      of the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence became intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to say my say,&rdquo; said a short man in a pea-jacket,&mdash;a retired
      San Francisco pilot, named Eldridge. &ldquo;I entertain no doubt the man is
      guilty. At the same time, I allow for differences of opinion. I don't know
      this man that's voted 'not guilty,' but he seems to be a well-meaning man.
      I don't know his reasons; probably he don't understand the case. I should
      like to have the foreman tell the evidence over, so as if he don't see it
      clear, he can ask questions, and we can explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I second de motion,&rdquo; said George Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general rustle of approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move it,&rdquo; said the pilot, encouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Mr. Eldridge,&rdquo; said the foreman. &ldquo;If there is no objection, I
      will state the evidence, and if there is any loop-hole, I will trouble Mr.
      Smith to suggest it as I go along;&rdquo; and he proceeded to give a summary of
      the testimony, with homely force.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, sir?&rdquo; he said, when he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I move for another ballot,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result was the same. Eli had voted &ldquo;not guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Smith,&rdquo; said the foreman, &ldquo;this must be settled in some way. This is
      no child's play. You can't keep eleven men here, trifling with them,
      giving no pretence of a reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have n't no reasons, only that I don't believe he 's guilty,&rdquo; said Eli.
      &ldquo;I 'm not goin' to vote a man into State's-prison, when I don't believe he
      done it,&rdquo; and he rose and walked to the window and looked out. It was low
      tide. There was a broad stretch of mud in the distance, covered with boats
      lying over disconsolate. A driving storm had emptied the streets. He beat
      upon the rain-dashed glass a moment with his fingers, and then he sat down
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the foreman, &ldquo;this is singular conduct. What do you
      propose to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you realize that the rest of us are pretty rapidly forming a
      conclusion on this matter,&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come! come!&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge; &ldquo;don't be quite so hard on him, Captain.
      Now, Mr. Smith,&rdquo; he said, standing up with his hands in his coat-pockets
      and looking at Eli, &ldquo;we know that there often is crooked sticks on juries,
      that hold out alone&mdash;that's to be expected; but they always argue,
      and stand to it the rest are fools, and all that. Now, all is, we don't
      see why you don't sort of argue, if you 've got reasons satisfactory to
      you. Come, now,&rdquo; he added, walking up to Eli, and resting one foot on the
      seat of his chair, &ldquo;why don't you tell it over? and if we 're wrong, I 'm
      ready to join you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli looked up at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did n't you ever know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of a man's takin' a cat off, to lose,
      that his little girl did n't want drownded, and leavin' him ashore, twenty
      or thirty miles, bee-line, from home, and that cat's bein' back again the
      next day, purrin' 'round 's if nothin' had happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge&mdash;&ldquo;knew of just such a case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Eli; &ldquo;how does he find his way home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't know,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge; &ldquo;always has been a standing mystery to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Eli, &ldquo;mark my words. There's such a thing as arguin', and
      there 's such a thing as knowin' outright; and when you 'll tell me how
      that cat inquires his way home, I '11 tell you how I know John Wood ain't
      guilty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This made a certain sensation, and Eli's stock went up.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old, withered man rapped on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and there's other sing'lar things! How is it that a
      seafarin' man, that 's dyin' to home, will allers die on the ebbtide? It
      never fails, but how does it happen? Tell me that! And there's more ways
      than one of knowin' things, too!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that man ain't guilty,&rdquo; said Eli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hark ye!&rdquo; said a dark old man with a troubled face, rising and pointing
      his finger toward Eli. &ldquo;<i>Know</i>, you say? I <i>knew</i>, wunst. I <i>knew</i>
      that my girl, my only child, was good. One night she went off with a
      married man that worked in my store, and stole my money&mdash;and where is
      she now?&rdquo; And then he added, &ldquo;What I <i>know</i> is, that every man hes
      his price. I hev mine, and you hev yourn!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Xcuse me, Mr. Speaker,&rdquo; said George Washington, rising with his hand in
      his bosom; &ldquo;as de question is befo' us, I wish to say that de las' bro'
      mus' have spoken under 'xcitement. Every man <i>don</i>' have his price!
      An' I hope de bro' will recant&mdash;like as de Psalmist goes out o' his
      way to say '<i>In my haste</i> I said, All men are liars.' He was a very
      busy man, de Psalmist&mdash;writin' down hymns all day, sharpen'n' his
      lead-pencil, bossin' 'roun' de choir&mdash;callin' Selah! Well, bro'n an'
      sisters &ldquo;&mdash;both arms going out, and his voice going up&mdash;&rdquo; one
      day, seems like, he was in gre't haste&mdash;got to finish a psalm for a
      monthly concert, or such&mdash;and some man in-corrupted him, and lied;
      and bein' in gre't haste&mdash;and a little old Adam in him&mdash;he says,
      right off, quick: '<i>All</i> men are liars!' But see! When he gits a
      little time to set back and meditate, he says: 'Dis won' do&mdash;dere's
      Moses an' Job, an' Paul&mdash;dey ain't liars!' An' den he don' sneak out,
      and 'low he said, 'All men is lions,' or such. No! de Psalmist ain't no
      such man; but he owns up, 'an 'xplains. '<i>In my haste</i>,' he says, 'I
      said it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman rose and rapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I await a motion,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if our friend will allow me the privilege of
      speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Washington calmly bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the foreman, when nobody seemed disposed to move, speaking slowly at
      first, and piecemeal, alternating language with smoke, gradually edged
      into the current of the evidence, and ended by going all over it again,
      with fresh force and point. His cigar glowed and chilled in the darkening
      room as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, when he had drawn all the threads together to the point of
      guilt, &ldquo;what are we going to do upon this evidence?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I 'll tell you something,&rdquo; said Eli. &ldquo;I did n't want to say it because I
      know what you 'll all think, but I 'll tell you, all the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eli stood up and faced the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Most all o' you know what our Bar is in a southeast gale. They ain't a
      man here that would dare to try and cross it when the sea's breakin' on
      it. The man that says he would, lies!&rdquo; And he looked at the foreman, and
      waited a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When my wife took sick, and I stopped goin' to sea, two year ago, and
      took up boat-fishin', I did n't know half as much about the coast as the
      young boys do, and one afternoon it was blowin' a gale, and we was all
      hands comin' in, and passin' along the Bar to go sheer 'round it to the
      west'ard, and Captain Fred Cook&mdash;he's short-sighted&mdash;got on to
      the Bar before he knew it, and then he hed to go ahead, whether or no; and
      I was right after him, and I s'posed he knew, and I followed him. Well, he
      was floated over, as luck was, all right; but when I 'd just got on the
      Bar, a roller dropped back and let my bowsprit down into the sand, and
      then come up quicker'n lightnin' and shouldered the boat over, t' other
      end first, and slung me into the water; and when I come up, I see
      somethin' black, and there was John Wood's boat runnin' by me before the
      wind with a rush&mdash;and 'fore I knew an'thing, he had me by the hair by
      one hand, and in his boat, and we was over the Bar. Now, I tell you, a man
      that looks the way I saw him look when I come over the gunwale, face up,
      don't go 'round breakin' in and hookin' things. He hed n't one chance in
      five, and he was a married man, too, with small children. And what's
      more,&rdquo; he added incautiously, &ldquo;he did n't stop there. When he found out,
      this last spring, that I was goin' to lose my place, he lent me money
      enough to pay the interest that was overdue on the mortgage, of his own
      accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he stopped suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have certainly explained yourself,&rdquo; said the foreman. &ldquo;I think we
      understand you distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is n't one word of truth in that idea,&rdquo; said Eli, flushing up, &ldquo;and
      you know it. I 've paid him back every cent. I know him better 'n any of
      you, that's all, and when I know he ain't guilty, I won't say he is; and I
      can set here as long as any other man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lively times some folks 'll hev, when they go home,&rdquo; said a spare
      tin-pedler, stroking his long yellow goatee. &ldquo;Go into the store: nobody
      speak to you; go to cattle-show: everybody follow you 'round; go to the
      wharf: nobody weigh your fish; go to buy seed-cakes to the cart: baker
      won't give no tick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much does it cost, Mr. Foreman,&rdquo; said the butcher, &ldquo;for a man 't 's
      obliged to leave town, to move a family out West? I only ask for
      information. I have known a case where a man had to leave&mdash;could n't
      live there no longer&mdash;wa' n't wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a knock. An officer, sent by the judge, inquired whether the
      jury were likely soon to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It rests with you, sir,&rdquo; said the foreman, looking at Eli.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Eli sat doggedly with his hands in his pockets, and did not look up or
      speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to the judge that I cannot tell,&rdquo; said the foreman.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was eight o'clock when the officer returned, with orders to take the
      jury across the street to the hotel, to supper. They went out in pairs,
      except that the juryman who was left to fall in with Eli made three with
      the file ahead, and left Eli to walk alone. This was noticed by the
      bystanders. At the hotel, Eli could not eat a mouthful. He was seated at
      one end of the table, and was left entirely out of the conversation. When
      the jury were escorted back to the courthouse, rumors had evidently begun
      to arise from his having walked alone, for there was quite a little crowd
      at the hotel door, to see them. They went as before: four pairs, a file of
      three, and Eli alone. Then the spectators understood it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the jury were locked into their room again for the night, Mr.
      Eldridge sat down by Eli and lit his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;just how you feel. Now, between you and me,
      there was a good-hearted fellow that kept me out of a bad mess once. I 've
      never told anybody just what it was, and I don't mean to tell you now, but
      it brought my blood up standing, to find how near I 'd come to putting a
      fine steamer and two hundred and forty passengers under water. Well, one
      day, a year or so after that, this man had a chance to get a good ship,
      only there was some talk against him, that he drank a little. Well, the
      owners told him they wanted to see me, and he come to me, and says he,
      'Mr. Eldridge, I hope you 'll speak a good word for me; if you do, I 'll
      get the ship, but if they refuse me this one, I 'm dished everywhere.'
      Well, the owners put me the square question, and I had to tell 'em. Well,
      I met him that afternoon on Sacramento Street, as white as a sheet, and he
      would n't speak to me, but passed right by, and that night he went and
      shipped before the mast. That's the last I ever heard of him; but I had to
      do it. Now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;this man 's been good to you; but the case is
      proved, and you ought to vote with the rest of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't proved,&rdquo; said Eli. &ldquo;The judge said that if any man had a
      reasonable doubt, he ought to hold out. Now, I ain't convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that 's easy said,&rdquo; replied Mr. Eldridge, a little hotly, and he
      arose, and left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jurymen broke up into little knots, tilted their chairs back, and
      settled into the easiest positions that their cramped quarters allowed.
      Most of them lit their pipes; the captain, and one or two whom he honored,
      smoked fragrant cigars, and the room was soon filled with a dense cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eli sat alone by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes sell two at one house,&rdquo; said a lank book-agent, arousing
      himself from a reverie; &ldquo;once sold three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the Early Rose is about as profitable as any,&rdquo; said a little
      farmer, with a large circular beard. &ldquo;I used to favor Jacobs's Seedling,
      but they have n't done so well with me of late years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; said the book-agent, picking his teeth with a quill, &ldquo;you 'll
      go to a house, and they 'll say they can't be induced to buy a book of any
      kind, historical, fictitious, or religious; but you just keep on talking,
      and show the pictures&mdash;'Grant in Boyhood,' 'Grant a Tanner,' Grant at
      Head-quarters,' 'Grant in the White House,' 'Grant before Queen Victoria,'
      and they warm up, I tell you, and not infrequently buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you sell de 'Illustrated Bible',&rdquo; asked Washington, &ldquo;wid de
      Hypocrypha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I have a more popular treatise&mdash;the 'Illustrated History of the
      Bible.' Greater variety. Brings in the surrounding nations, in costume.
      Cloth, three dollars; sheep, three-fifty; half calf, five-seventy-five;
      full morocco, gilt edges, seven-fifty. Six hundred and seven illustrations
      on wood and steel. Three different engravings of Abraham alone. Four of
      Noah,&mdash;'Noah before the Flood,' 'Noah Building the Ark,' 'Noah
      Welcoming the Dove,' 'Noah on Ararat,' Steel engraving of Ezekiel's Wheel,
      explaining prophecy. Jonah under the gourd, Nineveh in the distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eldridge and Captain Thomas had drifted into a discussion of harbors,
      and the captain had drawn his chair up to the table, and, with a cigar in
      his mouth, was explaining an ingeniously constructed foreign harbor. He
      was making a rough sketch, with a pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is north,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;here is the coastline; here are the flats; here
      are the sluicegates; they store the water here, in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some of the younger men had their heads together, in a corner, about the
      tin-pedler, who was telling stories of people he had met in his journeys,
      which brought out repeated bursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the corner farthest from Eli, a delicate-looking man began to tell the
      butcher about Eli's wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twelve years ago this fall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I taught district-school in the
      parish where she lived. She was about fourteen then. Her father was a poor
      farmer, without any faculty. Her mother was dead, and she kept house. I
      stayed there one week, boarding 'round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Prob'ly did n't git not much of any fresh meat that week,&rdquo; suggested the
      butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She never said much, but it used to divert me to see her order around her
      big brothers, just as if she was their mother. She and I got to be great
      friends; but she was a queer piece. One day at school the girls in her row
      were communicating, and annoying me, while the third class was reciting in
      'First Steps in Numbers,' and I was so incensed that I called Lizzie&mdash;that's
      her name&mdash;right out, and had her stand up for twenty minutes. She was
      a shy little thing, and set great store by perfect marks. I saw that she
      was troubled a good deal, to have all of them looking and laughing at her.
      But she stood there, with her hands folded behind her, and not a smile or
      a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out for a sullen cow,&rdquo; said the butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt afraid I had been too hasty with her, and I was rather sorry I had
      been so decided&mdash;although, to be sure, she did n't pretend to deny
      that she had been communicating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said the butcher: &ldquo;no use lyin' when you 're caught in the
      act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, after school, she stayed at her desk, fixing her dinner-pail, and
      putting her books in a strap, and all that, till all the rest had gone,
      and then she came up to my desk, where I was correcting compositions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now for music!&rdquo; said the butcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had been crying a little. Well, she looked straight in my face, and
      said she, 'Mr. Pollard, I just wanted to say to you that I was n't doing
      anything at all when you called me up;' and off she went. Now, that was
      just like her,&mdash;too proud to say a word before the school.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But here his listener's attention was diverted by the voice of the
      book-agent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best Bible for teachers, of course, is the limp-cover, protected
      edges, full Levant morocco, Oxford, silk-sewed, kid-lined, Bishop's
      Divinity Circuit, with concordance, maps of the Holy Land, weights,
      measures, and money-tables of the Jews. Nothing like having a really&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so,&rdquo; said the captain, moving back his chair, &ldquo;they let on the whole
      head of water, and scour out the channel to a T.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he rapped upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;please draw your chairs up, and let us take another
      ballot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The count resulted as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foreman muttered something which had a scriptural sound. In a few
      moments he drew Mr. Eldridge and two others aside. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said to
      them, &ldquo;I shall quietly divide the jury into watches, under your charge:
      ten can sleep, while one wakes to keep Mr. Smith discussing the question.
      I don't propose to have the night wasted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, by one man or another, Eli was kept awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see,&rdquo; said the book-agent, &ldquo;why you should feel obliged to stick
      it out any longer. Of course, you are under obligations. But you 've done
      more than enough already, so as that he can't complain of you, and if you
      give in now, everybody 'll give you credit for trying to save your friend,
      on the one hand, and, on the other hand, for giving in to the evidence. So
      you 'll get credit both ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An hour later, the tin-pedler came on duty. He had not followed closely
      the story about John Wood's loan, and had got it a little awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, how foolish you be,&rdquo; he said, in a confidential tone. &ldquo;Can't you see
      that if you cave in now, after stan'n' out nine hours&rdquo;&mdash;and he looked
      at a silver watch with a brass chain, and stroked his goatee&mdash;&ldquo;nine
      hours and twenty-seven minutes&mdash;that you 've made jest rumpus enough
      so as't he won't dare to foreclose on you, for fear they 'll say you went
      back on a trade. On t' other hand, if you hold clear out, he'll turn you
      out-o'-doors to-morrow, for a blind, so 's to look as if there wa' n't no
      trade between you. Once he gits off, he won't know Joseph, you bet! That's
      what I 'd do,&rdquo; he added, with a sly laugh. &ldquo;Take your uncle's advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The only trouble with that,&rdquo; said Eli, shortly, &ldquo;is that I don't owe him
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said the pedler; &ldquo;that makes a difference. I understood you did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Three o'clock came, and brought Mr. El-dridge. He found Eli worn out with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I don't judge you the way the others do,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge, in a
      low tone, with his hand on Eli's knee. &ldquo;I know, as I told you, just the
      way you feel. But we can't help such things. Suppose, now, that I had kept
      dark, and allowed to the owners that that man was always sober, and I had
      heard, six months after, of thirty or forty men going to the bottom
      because the captain was a little off his base; and then to think of their
      wives and children at home. We have to do some hard things; but I say, do
      the square thing, and let her slide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't believe he 's guilty,&rdquo; said Eli.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you allow,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge, &ldquo;that eleven men are more sure
      to hit it right than one man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Eli, reluctantly, &ldquo;as a general thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's always got to be some give to a jury, just as in everything
      else, and you ought to lay right down on the rest of us. It is n't as if
      we were at all squirmish. Now, you know that if you hold out, he 'll be
      tried again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to be&mdash;no other way,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge. &ldquo;Now, the next time,
      there won't be anybody like you to stand out, and the judge 'll know of
      this scrape, and he'll just sock it to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli turned uneasily in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And then it won't be understood in your place, and folks 'll turn against
      you every way, and, what's worse, let you alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can stand it,&rdquo; said Eli, angrily. &ldquo;Let 'em do as they like. They can't
      kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can kill your wife and break down your children,&rdquo; said Mr. Eldridge.
      &ldquo;Women and children can't stand it. Now, there's that man they were
      speaking of; he lived down my way. He sued a poor, shiftless fellow that
      had come from Pennsylvania to his daughter's funeral, and had him arrested
      and taken off, crying, just before the funeral begun&mdash;after they 'd
      even set the flowers on the coffin; and nobody'd speak to him after that&mdash;they
      just let him alone; and after a while his wife took sick of it&mdash;she
      was a nice, kindly woman&mdash;and she had sort of hysterics, and finally
      he moved off West. And 't was n't long before the woman died. Now, you
      can't undertake to do different from everybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Eli, &ldquo;I know I wish it was done with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Eldridge stretched his arms and yawned. Then he began to walk up and
      down, and hum, out of tune. Then he stopped at Captain Thomas's chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose we try a ballot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He seems to give a little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the foreman rapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is time we were taking another ballot, gentlemen,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sleepers rose, grumbling, from uneasy dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will write 'guilty' on twelve ballots,&rdquo; said the foreman, &ldquo;and if any
      one desires to write in 'not,' of course he can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the hat came to Eli, he took one of the ballots and held it in his
      hand a moment, and then he laid it on the table. There was a general
      murmur. The picture which Mr. El-dridge had drawn loomed up before him.
      But with a hasty hand he wrote in &ldquo;not,&rdquo; dropped in the ballot, and going
      back to his chair by the window, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a cold wave of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Eli suddenly walked up to the foreman and faced him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we 'll stop. The very next turn breaks ground. If you, or
      any other man that you set on, tries to talk to me when I don't want to
      hear, to worry me to death&mdash;look out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      How the long hours wore on! How easy, sometimes, to resist an open
      pressure, and how hard, with the resistance gone, to fight, as one that
      beats the air! How the prospect of a whole hostile town loomed up, in a
      mirage, before Eli! And then the picture rose before him of a long,
      stately bark, now building, whose owner had asked him yesterday to be
      first mate. And if his wife were only well, and he were only free from
      this night's trouble, how soon, upon the long, green waves, he could begin
      to redeem his little home!
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came Mr. Eldridge, kind and friendly, to have another little
      chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came, cold and drizzly. An officer knocked at the door, and called
      out, &ldquo;Breakfast!&rdquo; And in a moment, unwashed, and all uncombed, except the
      tin-pedler, who always carried a beard-comb in his pocket, they were
      marched across the street to the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a number of men on the piazza waiting to see them,&mdash;jurymen,
      witnesses, and the accused himself, for he was on bail. He had seen the
      procession the night before, and, like the others, had read its meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eli knows I would n't do it,&rdquo; he had said to himself, &ldquo;and he's going to
      hang out, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The jury began to turn from the court-house door. Everybody looked. A file
      of two men, another file, another, another; would there come three men,
      and then one? No; Eli no longer walked alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody looked at Wood; he turned sharply away.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time the order of march in fact showed nothing, one way or the
      other. It only meant that the judge, who had happened to see the jury the
      night before returning from their supper, had sent for the high sheriff in
      some temper,&mdash;for judges are human,&mdash;and had vigorously
      intimated that if that statesman did not look after his fool of a deputy,
      who let a jury parade secrets to the public view, he would!
    </p>
    <p>
      The jury were in their room again. At nine o'clock came a rap, and a
      summons from the court. The prosecuting attorney was speaking with the
      judge when they went in. In a moment he took his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Wood!&rdquo; called out the clerk, and the defendant arose. His attorney
      was not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Foreman!&rdquo; said the judge, rising. The jury arose. The silence of the
      crowded courtroom was intense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before the clerk asks you for a verdict, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;I
      have something of the first importance to say to you, which has but this
      moment come to my knowledge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli changed color, and the whole court-room looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There were some most singular rumors, after the case was given to you,
      gentlemen, to the effect that there had been in this cause a criminal
      abuse of justice. It is painful to suspect, and shocking to know, that
      courts and juries are liable ever to suffer by such unprincipled
      practices. After ten years upon the bench, I never witness a conviction of
      crime without pain; but that pain is light, compared with the distress of
      knowing of a wilful perversion of justice. It is a relief to me to be able
      to say to you that such instances are, in my judgment, exceedingly rare,
      and&mdash;so keen is the awful searching power of truth&mdash;are almost
      invariably discovered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The foreman touched his neighbor with his elbow. Eli folded his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As I said,&rdquo; continued the judge, &ldquo;there were most singular rumors. During
      the evening and the night, rumor, as is often the case, led to evidence,
      and evidence has led to confession and to certainty. And the district
      attorney now desires me to say to you that the chief officer of the bank&mdash;who
      held the second key to the safe&mdash;is now under arrest for a heavy
      defalcation, which a sham robbery was to conceal, and that you may find
      the prisoner at the bar&mdash;not guilty. I congratulate you, gentlemen,
      that you had not rendered an adverse verdict.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your Honor!&rdquo; said Eli, and he cleared his throat, &ldquo;I desire it to be
      known that, even as the case stood last night, this jury had not agreed to
      convict, and never would have!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hush, while a loud scratching pen indorsed the record of
      acquittal. Then Wood walked down to the jury-box and took Eli's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I told my wife all through,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I knew you 'd hang out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eli's jury was excused for the rest the of day, and by noon he was in his
      own village, relieved, too, of his most pressing burden: for George Cahoon
      had met him on the road, and told him that he was not going to the West,
      after all, for the present, and should not need his money. But, as he
      turned the bend of the road and neared his house, he felt a rising fear
      that some disturbing rumor might have reached his wife about his action on
      the jury. And, to his distress and amazement, there she was, sitting in a
      chair at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lizzie!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does this mean? Are you crazy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what it means,&rdquo; she said, as she stood up with a little
      smile and clasped her hands behind her. &ldquo;This morning it got around and
      came to me that you was standing out all alone for John Wood, and that the
      talk was that they 'd be down on you, and drive you out of town, and that
      everybody pitied <i>me</i>,&mdash;<i>pitied me!</i> And when I heard that,
      I thought I 'd see! And my strength seemed to come all back, and I got
      right up and dressed myself. And what's more, I 'm going to get well now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she did.
